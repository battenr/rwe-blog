First, we need to understand what is meant by these terms. To do that, can you guess what we are going to start with? Yup! Probability again.\n\n## Conditional vs Unconditional Probability\n\nFirst things first. Let's review some basic probability terms. Unconditional probability, denoted as $P(A)$, is the probability that something will happen. Unconditional probability sounds like a mouthful, so we will use marginal instead. For example, let's assume in a made-up world that the probability of you getting a visit from the toothfairy is 0.30 on any given night. In mathematical terms:\n\n\n$$\nP(toothfairy) = 0.30\n$$\n\n\nNow, the toothfairy randomly visiting you seems a bit bizarre doesn't it? She'd just drop by any night for no reason at all? Seems unlikely. She'd probably visit after you had a tooth fall out. That can be worded as \"the probability that the toothfairy will visit, given that a tooth fell out\". Using mathematical notation again:\n\n\n$$\nP\n$$\n\n\n## \n\n## 2x2 Table\n\nFirst, lets start with a 2x2 table. It could be of anything really, but let's imagine we have two groups of people\n\n\n\n\n\n+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+\n|                  | Bubble Gum Chewers | Tobacco Chewers | Total          |\n|                  |                    |                 |                |\n|                  | (n = 426)          | ( n = 359)      |                |\n+:================:+:==================:+:===============:+:==============:+\n| **Sore Jaw**     | 78                 | 228             | 306            |\n+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+\n| **Not Sore Jaw** | 348                | 131             | 479            |\n+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+\n|                  | 426                | 359             | **785**        |\n+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+----------------+\n\n: Bubble Gum Chewers vs Tobacco Chewers {#tbl-bgtc}\n",
