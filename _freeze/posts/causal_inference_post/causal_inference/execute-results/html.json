This book was tremendous and changed my thinking about \"correlation doesn't equal causation\".\\\n\\\nFrom introductory science, as scientists, we are taught that correlation doesn't equal causation. I had never questioned this until I was in my MSc program and started thinking about the association between lung cancer and smokers. @RN816 reported an odds ratio of 40.4 (95% CI: 21.8-79.6), which to me seemed high.\n\nNow there are two ways to interpret this. On one hand, if we were a tobacco company we could argue that the 95% CI is pretty wide, indicating that the estimate is not that precise and the statistical method used must be wrong, etc (by etc, I mean whatever excuses you want to use). On the other hand, even at the lower limit an odds ratio of 21.8 is pretty damn high. In my opinion, this would require at the very least more investigation to determine \"does smoking cause lung cancer?\"\n\n## Common Ground\n\nPrior to diving straight into the world of causal inference, we first need to set some common ground rules.\n\n::: callout-note\nKeep in mind causal inference is a broad field and will be the subject of many subsequent posts, this is just an introductory post or wetting your beak if you will.\n:::\n\n### Confound It!  {#sec-confound}\n\nIn order to get to the bottom of \"does X cause Y?\" we need to outlined some key methodological concepts. First, we need to outline what confounding is and clearly define what we mean.\n\nDifferent disciplines used different terminology, however confounding in clinical epidemiology refers to a variable that impacts both the exposure (i.e., smoking) and outcome (i.e., lung cancer). A useful way to visualize this is using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). I'll defer to @RN509 for more detail about DAGs. However, the below illustrates what confounding is.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Coffee Drinkers, Smoking and Lung Cancer.](causal_inference_files/figure-html/fig-confound-1.png){#fig-confound width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-confound shows that coffee drinkers are associated with smoking. Logically, this makes sense because many smokers enjoy a cup of coffee with their cigarette. In fact, a lot of people enjoy coffee. A group of these people who are coffee lovers may also develop lung cancer. Based on this, you could say that people who drink coffee develop lung cancer. The question is, is this true? Or is it just that a lot of people like drinking coffee? Confounding bias, makes it difficult to tease out what coffee actually causes.\n\n### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)\n\nRandomized controlled trials are typically considered the gold standard in research. However, sometimes people forget why they are considered the gold standard. There are of course numerous reasons but I will touch on a few here. Firstly, an RCT is randomized meaning that patient's are *randomly* assigned to one of the treatment arms. In *theory,* this is to ensure that characteristics are balanced between the treatment arms. By balancing characteristics, in theory, both observed and unobserved confounders are equal between the groups, making them exchangeable (aka equal).\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nRandom is important to note here. There are different methods which are truly random, such as a random number generator, while there are others that are not.\n\nFor example, if you were picking players for a baseball team and wanted to assign people to two teams, team A & team B, how would you do it? Based on the color shirt they are wearing, hair color, eye color? None of those methods would be random.\n\n:::\n\nAnother key strength of RCTs, is the nature of the intervention. For example, a well designed RCT will be very clear about what treatment is received by the participants.\n\n### Observational Data\n\nObservational data in research often gets a bad wrap. The gold standard is randomized controlled trials (RCTs), however often times people forget why this is. RCTs provide\n\n## Assumptions Required for Causal Inference\n\nReal-life is very complicated. For any method or analysis, such as designing a house, assumptions are required. This is is no different for causal inference. Key assumptions for causal inference include:\n\n-   Exchangeability\n\n-   Positivity\n\n-   Consistency\n\n-   No versions of treatment\n\n-   No interference\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nCollectively, consistency, no versions of treatment and no interference have been referred to as the stable-unit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA) [@hernan2012beyond].\n\n:::\n\nLet's break down these assumptions down one by one.\n\n### Exchangeability\n\nRemember confounding from earlier? Well that pesky bias is back again to haunt us.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nRecommend to pause here and re-read @sec-confound if needed\n\n:::\n\nThe goal, although not always, of a lot of RCTs is to compare two treatments, for example drug A to placebo or to compare purple Popsicle eaters with water drinkers. An example always helps.\n\nLet's pretend we want to compare popsicle eaters with water drinkers, to see if there is a difference in who is hungrier. Conducting our very own RCT, we enroll 591\n\n\n\n\n\n+----------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+\n| Demographic Variable | Purple Popsicle Eaters  | Water Drinkers        |\n|                      |                         |                       |\n|                      | (n = 250)               | (n = 341)             |\n+:====================:+:=======================:+:=====================:+\n| Age, mean (SD)       | 9.18 (3.39)             | 42.58 (22.03)         |\n+----------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+\n| Female, n (%)        | 190 (76.0%)             | 145 (42.5%)           |\n+----------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+\n\n: Purple Popsicle Eaters vs Water Drinkers: Demographic Characteristics\n\n### Positivity\n\n### Consistency\n\n### No Versions of Treatment\n\n### No Interference\n\n## When to use Cause\n\nIf these assumptions hold, then we can use the term cause!\n",
