This book was tremendous and changed my thinking about \"correlation doesn't equal causation\".\\\n\\\nFrom introductory science, as scientists, we are taught that correlation doesn't equal causation. I had never questioned this until I was in my MSc program and started thinking about the association between lung cancer and smokers. @RN816 reported an odds ratio of 40.4 (95% CI: 21.8-79.6), which to me seemed high.\n\nNow there are two ways to interpret this. On one hand, if we were a tobacco company we could argue that the 95% CI is pretty wide, indicating that the estimate is not that precise and the statistical method used must be wrong, etc (by etc, I mean whatever excuses you want to use). On the other hand, even at the lower limit an odds ratio of 21.8 is pretty damn high. In my opinion, this would require at the very least more investigation to determine \"does smoking cause lung cancer?\"\n\n## Common Ground\n\nPrior to diving straight into the world of causal inference, we first need to set some common ground rules.\n\n::: callout-note\nKeep in mind causal inference is a broad field and will be the subject of many subsequent posts, this is just an introductory post or wetting your beak if you will.\n:::\n\n### Confound It! {#sec-confound}\n\nIn order to get to the bottom of \"does X cause Y?\" we need to outlined some key methodological concepts. First, we need to outline what confounding is and clearly define what we mean.\n\nDifferent disciplines used different terminology, however confounding in clinical epidemiology refers to a variable that impacts both the exposure (i.e., smoking) and outcome (i.e., lung cancer). A useful way to visualize this is using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). I'll defer to @RN509 for more detail about DAGs. However, the below illustrates what confounding is.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Coffee Drinkers, Smoking and Lung Cancer.](causal_inference_files/figure-html/fig-confound-1.png){#fig-confound width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-confound shows that coffee drinkers are associated with smoking. Logically, this makes sense because many smokers enjoy a cup of coffee with their cigarette. In fact, a lot of people enjoy coffee. A group of these people who are coffee lovers may also develop lung cancer. Based on this, you could say that people who drink coffee develop lung cancer. The question is, is this true? Or is it just that a lot of people like drinking coffee? Confounding bias, makes it difficult to tease out what coffee actually causes.\n\n### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)\n\nRandomized controlled trials are typically considered the gold standard in research. However, sometimes people forget why they are considered the gold standard. There are of course numerous reasons but I will touch on a few here. Firstly, an RCT is randomized meaning that patient's are *randomly* assigned to one of the treatment arms. In *theory,* this is to ensure that characteristics are balanced between the treatment arms. By balancing characteristics, in theory, both observed and unobserved confounders are equal between the groups, making them exchangeable (aka similar).\n\n::: callout-note\nRandom is important to note here. There are different methods which are truly random, such as a random number generator, while there are others that are not.\n\nFor example, if you were picking players for a baseball team and wanted to assign people to two teams, team A & team B, how would you do it? Based on the color shirt they are wearing, hair color, eye color? None of those methods would be random.\n:::\n\nAnother key strength of RCTs, is the nature of the intervention. For example, a well designed RCT will be very clear about what treatment is received by the participants and that all participants will receive the same treatment. Furthermore, one participant receiving a treatment won't affect the other participant receiving treatment.\n\n### Observational Data\n\nObservational data in research often gets a bad wrap. The gold standard is randomized controlled trials (RCTs), however often times people forget why this is. RCTs provide\n\n## Conditions Required for Causal Inference\n\nReal-life is very complicated. For any method or analysis, such as designing a house, assumptions are required. This is is no different for causal inference. Key assumptions for causal inference include:\n\n-   Exchangeability\n\n-   Positivity\n\n-   Consistency\n\n-   No versions of treatment\n\n-   No interference\n\n::: callout-note\nCollectively, consistency, no versions of treatment and no interference have been referred to as the stable-unit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA) [@hernan2012beyond].\n:::\n\nLet's break down these assumptions down one by one.\n\n### Exchangeability\n\nRemember confounding from earlier? Well that pesky bias is back again to haunt us.\n\n::: callout-note\nRecommend to pause here and re-read @sec-confound if needed\n:::\n\nThe goal, although not always, of a lot of research is to compare two different exposures. An exposure could be a treatment, for example drug A to placebo, or to compare purple Popsicle eaters with water drinkers. An example always helps.\n\nLet's pretend we want to compare popsicle eaters with water drinkers, to see if there is a difference in who is hungrier. Using an existing database of hungry people, we decide we want to compare these two groups of people. In the database, there are 591 people who have reported hunger.\n\n\n\n\n\n+----------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+\n| Demographic Variable | Purple Popsicle Eaters | Water Drinkers        |\n|                      |                        |                       |\n|                      | (n = 250)              | (n = 341)             |\n+:====================:+:======================:+:=====================:+\n| Age, mean (SD)       | 9.18 (3.39)            | 42.58 (22.03)         |\n+----------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+\n| Female, n (%)        | 190 (76.0%)            | 145 (42.5%)           |\n+----------------------+------------------------+-----------------------+\n\n: Purple Popsicle Eaters vs Water Drinkers: Demographic Characteristics {#tbl-demo}\n\n@tbl-demo shows the average age and proportion of females in each of the two groups. Now, after looking at these two groups, you may think to yourself \"Wait a minute...water drinks on average are 42 while purple popsicle eaters are an average age of 9? These can't possible be compared\".\n\nYour inclination was right. These two groups are quite different and may vary in more ways than what is shown. This lack of similarity could be reworded as a lack of exchangeability. Luckily, there are fancy stats methods to fix this, which will be the topic of other posts.\n\n::: callout-important\nWhile we can adjust for observed confounding, it is not possible to adjust for unobserved confounding. We simply don't know about it, for example how many people in each group enjoy the taste of grape crush.\n:::\n\n### Positivity\n\nPositivity refers to the condition that every individual has a greater than 0 probability of being assigned to each of the treatment levels (@RN509, pp. 30). Logically, this makes sense because if we think about our purple Popsicle eaters and water drinks, if someone in that group had a less than 0 probability they couldn't possibly be in that group!\n\n### Consistency  {sec-consistency=\"\"}\n\nConsistency means that the observed outcome for every treated individual equals her outcome if she received treatment and that the observed outcome for every untreated individual equals her outcome if she had remained untreated, that is $Y^a = Y$ for every individual with $A = a$ (@RN509, pp. 31).\n\nOn the surface, this seems intuitive but lets dive a little deeper. There are two components to consistency:\n\n1.  A precise definition of the counterfactual outcome $Y^a$ via a detailed specification of the superscript $a$\n\n2.  Linkage of the counterfactual outcomes to the observed outcomes\n\nThe first bullet point is we essentially want to have a well defined intervention. If we think back to our purple Popsicles, we want to make sure that it is the same size, shape, brand that each participant receives. Doing this allows us to make sure that each participant is getting the same treatment.\n\nFor the second bullet point, remember we are using observational data for our purple Popsicle eaters. We have to make sure that for the analysis, we only treat people receiving our intervention (purple Popsicle eaters) as treated, or as popsicle eaters, and the others as not popsicle eaters.\n\n### No Versions of Treatment\n\nAs discussed in @sec-consistency, we cannot have multiple versions of the same treatment. This would muddy our findings if we were giving different people different popsicles. Plus, this would make it hard to determine the effect of purple Popsicles on hunger. Imagine, you gave some people a much bigger Popsicle than others. Of course they'd be less hungry!\n\n### No Interference\n\nInterference here refers to the\n\n## When to use Cause\n\nIf these assumptions hold, then we can use the term cause!\n",
