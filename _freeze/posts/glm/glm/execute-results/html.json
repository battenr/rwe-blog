Typically, the starting point is with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. This is where we will also start. Well? Let's get started!\n\n## Equation of a Line\n\nFrom high school math, you probably remember the equation of a line as:\n\n\n$$\ny = mx +b\n$$\n\n\nwhere $m$ is the slope\n\n## Ordinary Regression\n\nThe typical place to start with regression is ordinary least squares. This method tries to minimize the sum of squares of the differences between the observed variable and those predicted by the model (hence the *least squares*). Put otherwise: by minimizing the residuals. Another way to conceptualize this is by drawing the line of best fit. \\\n\\\nFor example, imagine we have a database and want to examine the association between age and the number of balloons that a person owns. Our database has four variables: age, sex, candy lover (yes/no) and the number of balloons the person owns. Now, if we draw a line of best fit through the data, we'll get the below figure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(2228) # August 28, 2022\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggxmean)\n\nn.id = 250\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  age = runif(n = n.id, min = c(5, 18), max = c(30, 85)),\n  sex = rbinom(n = n.id, size = 1, prob = c(0.60,0.20)),\n  candy_lover = rbinom(n = n.id, size = 1, prob = c(0.64, 0.45)),\n  \n  # Beta Coefficients\n  \n  beta_age = runif(n = n.id, min = 0, max = 0.10),\n  beta_sex = runif(n = n.id, min = 0, max = 0.30),\n  beta_candy = runif(n = n.id, min = 0, max = 0.40)\n) %>% \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    num_ballons = round((beta_age*age + beta_sex*sex + beta_candy*candy_lover)*3,0) # number of ballons that you own\n  )\n\nggplot2::ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = age, y = num_ballons)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  geom_lm() +\n  ggxmean::geom_lm_residuals(linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Number of Ballons Owned\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](glm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Mathematical Method0\n\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\n$$\n\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\beta}$ is the ordinary least squares estimator, $X$ is the and $y$ is the vector of the response variable.
