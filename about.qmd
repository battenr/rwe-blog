My undergraduate degree is in civil engineering, with a focus on structural engineering. After graduating, I decided that while I loved math, which is why I went into engineering in the first place, perhaps the career wasn't for me. I began looking for other opportunities/career paths when I had a meeting with my now supervisor. He introduced me to clinical epidemiology, which led me to start my MSc in 2016.

A few different work experiences later, I've been able to apply my clinical epidemiology training + LOVE of statistics + passion for math/big data to everyday life. As a result, I started my PhD in January 2021 in clinical epidemiology focusing on causal inference and real-world evidence.

# Experience

I've had a lot of different jobs relevant to research and not so relevant to research. There has been a wide range of jobs, varying from working as an engineering student, to as an estimator, to at a Canadian hardware store chain. Research relevant experience? I've worked as a student, consultant, on grants, for the Public Health Agency of Canada and most recently at EVERSANA. In my recent role, as a Biostatistician II I've been able to do what I love. Diving into various statistical methodologies, while working with talented people. More importantly, working with caring/nice people.

# Personal

Okay so you made it this far, I'm impressed! I probably wouldn't have read it this far to be honest so props to you. I LOVE statistics, figured I'd mention it again in case you didn't know that yet, but have outside work interests as well. I'm an avid sports fan. A Buffalo Sabres fan, which has been rough as of late and a Kansas City Chiefs fan (also kinda of rough as of late? Although recency bias is a real thing).

I am currently living in Halifax, Nova Scotia with my wife and daughter, and appreciate a good cider. While I live in Nova Scotia, I'm originally from Newfoundland (highly recommend people visit when the weather is nice, key is when).
