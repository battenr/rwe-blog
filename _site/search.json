    "text": "You may have seen real-world evidence (RWE) being used increasingly in research settings. It has tremendous potential for answering important research questions, however what exactly is RWE? RWE is evidence generated from real-world data (RWD). RWD is defined by the FDA as data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources (FDA December 2018). This data could be from electronic health records, medical claims and billing, electronic medical records, data from product registries, wearable devices, mobile devices and other sources. Sounds pretty good right? Well the quality of the evidence is only as a good as the quality of the study conducted."

A well-conducted RCT can provide insight into efficacy of a treatment in a controlled environment so that no data is missing, both observed and unobserved confounders are balanced between groups and you can measure the variables you need for analysis. There are however, drawbacks/potential limitations: RCTs can be expensive to conduct, can require a long duration of follow-up, are not feasible to conduct ethically, limited sample size for assessing safety and limited generalizability. Luckily, observational study designs can help fill in the gaps in these areas."

For example, is a poorly conducted RCT better than a rigorously conducted case-control study using observational data? That is up for debate however, observational studies can be used to supplement findings from RCTs or where RCTs are infeasible.\n\nOne of the key issues with observational studies is the variability in methodological rigor. Due to this, results can vary widely from study to study and really depend upon the researchers conducting the study. Luckily, recent strides have been made in this field. To mention a few, the STaRT-RWE template (Wang et al. 2021) and the principles behind emulating a target trial proposed by Hernan & Robins (Hernán and Robins 2016)."

    "text": "Examples of RWE\nDiscussing about RWE in theory is useful but what are some use cases? Recently, regulatory bodies are accepting RWE as part of submissions. These can vary from accepting burden of illness studies to help contextualize the current treatment and cost of available treatments to external control arms (ECA). ECAs can be beneficial when a single arm clinical trial is conducted. In certain disease areas, such as cancer, single arm trials are common but this makes it difficult for regulatory reviewers to ascertain the efficacy of a treatment since there is no comparator arm. Demonstration of safety is another area that RWE is well-suited due to the larger sample size and the generalizability of findings to real-world settings.\nPurpura et al. (Purpura et al. 2022) reported 116 FDA-approvals of New Drug and Biologics License Applications. Of these 116, 83 used RWE to support therapeutic context and 88 used RWE to support safety and/or effectiveness. Over the coming years, these numbers are expected to rise as the methodological rigor of these studies increases."

However, always keep in mind that these studies need to be conducted to similar standards that we would hope a clinical trial is."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s start with probability because that’s probably a good place to start. Probability is basically how likely something is to occur. For example, what are the chances that my favorite show will come on TV today? Or how likely is it that it will rain today? Based upon these probabilities you can make informed decisions. The neat thing about probability, is that you can incorporate it into different measures when conducting scientific research. An example of this is the odds that something will happen, similar to how a betting line works when gambling.\n\nTo convert from probability to odds, the formula is the probability of something happening divided by the probability of that something not happening. In mathematical terms:\n\\[\nodds = p/(1-p)\n\\]\nAn example always helps to contextualize the principles. What are the odds that my favorite candy will be available at the movie theatre tonight? Well, if the probability (p) is 0.70 that it will be there tonight, then the odds are:\n\n\\[\nodds = (0.70) / (1-0.70) = 0.70/0.30 = 2.33\n\\]\nThis means that the odds are 2.33:1 that my candy will be there tonight. Hooray!\nOdds are useful, however often times in research we want to know how the ratio of these two odds can be compared. For example, are women more likely to have a heart attack than men? To answer this, we turn to odds ratios (OR)."

    "section": "Odds Ratios",
    "text": "Odds Ratios\nOdds ratios essentially take two different odds, as explained above, and compared them to each other. For example, we have the below table (note: these numbers were simulated, not from an actual study). So the odds of men with a heart condition is 87/176 = 0.49, compared to women with a heart condition. If we do the same for the subgroup of patients with no heart condition: 101/147 = 0.69.\n\nNow, these odds are great but really we want to know, how do men and women compare? Well, we take the ratio of these two values. 0.49/0.69 = 0.71 and…dramatic pause… now you have an odds ratio!\n\n\nTable 1: Contingency Table for Heart Attack by Sex\n\n\n\nMen\nWomen\nTotal\n\n\nHeart Attack\n87\n176\n263\n\n\nNo Heart Attack\n101\n147\n248\n\n\nTotal\n188\n323\n511\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation for this would be that men have a decreased odds of having a heart attack than women. If this is hard to interpret, personally I find it easier to contextualize ORs > 1 to other people, you can take the reciprocal of the OR and flip what is called the reference group. So women have increased odds, 1.41, of having a heart attack (1 / 0.71 = 1.41)."

The formula for relative risk is\n\\[\nRR = (87/263) / (101/248) = 0.33/0.407 = 0.81\n\\]\nAgain, this means that men with a heart condition have a decreased risk compared to women. It is important to note here that the relative risk is specific to the study that was conducted. In our example, RR = 0.81 for the 511 people included in our study.\n\nThis is a very important distinction to make because people have varying degrees of baseline risk. As such, sometimes ORs and RRs are used interchangeably however they are distinctly different. In an upcoming post, I will elaborate on transportability."

    "section": "Hazard Ratios",
    "text": "Hazard Ratios\nHazard ratios are typically reported from time-to-event analyses, whereas odds ratios and relative risks are calculated from binary events: yes/no. Due to this, hazards cannot be explained quite as simple using a table, however that isn’t a problem.\nA hazard is the probability that an individual has an event at that time t Clark et al. (2003). Alternatively, it represents the instantaneous event rate for an individual. This is commonly used in survival analyses, which we will touch on in a later post, however it doesn’t have to be for survival (sometimes a common misconception). The hazard is for the event. Since it is a time-to-event measure, it could be used to determine the probability that my socks will instantaneously fall off. The typical notation for a hazard is \\(h(t)\\) or \\(\\lambda(t)\\)\nAs with the previous two ratios, it is a ratio. So if we use the same heart attack example, Table 1, except this time we are analyzing the time-to-heart attack then we can calculate a hazard for each group. Unfortunately, the math is not quite as straightforward so I’ll save you the pain. Using an appropriate model, a subsequent post will touch on models for time-to-event analysis but a common methods you may have heard of is Cox Proportional Hazards Model (note: if proportional hazards assumption is held, then hazard is cumulative Clark et al. (2003).\nUsing this imaginary model, we calculated the hazard for men \\(h(men)\\) as 0.20 and the hazard for women \\(h(women)\\) as 0.369. Now, we take the ratio of these two hazards and….*I’ll pause while you roll your eyes*….bingo! We have a hazard ratio (HR):\n\\[\nHR = h(men)/h(women) = 0.20/0.369 = 0.542.\n\\]\nThe interpretation for this is that men, yet again, have a lower probability of having an instantaneous heart attack than women (HR = 0.542)."

    "text": "I was first introduced to causal inference by Hernan and Robins (2021), in the summer of 2021 prior to starting my PhD. This book was tremendous and changed my thinking about “correlation doesn’t equal causation”.\n\nFrom introductory science, as scientists, we are taught that correlation doesn’t equal causation. I had never questioned this until I was in my MSc program and started thinking about the association between lung cancer and smokers. Stellman et al. (2001) reported an odds ratio of 40.4 (95% CI: 21.8-79.6), which to me seemed high.\nNow there are two ways to interpret this. On one hand, if we were a tobacco company we could argue that the 95% CI is pretty wide, indicating that the estimate is not that precise and the statistical method used must be wrong, etc (by etc, I mean whatever excuses you want to use). On the other hand, even at the lower limit an odds ratio of 21.8 is pretty damn high. In my opinion, this would require at the very least more investigation to determine “does smoking cause lung cancer?”"

    "section": "Common Ground",
    "text": "Common Ground\nPrior to diving straight into the world of causal inference, we first need to set some common ground rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind causal inference is a broad field and will be the subject of many subsequent posts, this is just an introductory post or wetting your beak if you will.\n\n\n\nConfound It!\nIn order to get to the bottom of “does X cause Y?” we need to outlined some key methodological concepts. First, we need to outline what confounding is and clearly define what we mean.\nDifferent disciplines used different terminology, however confounding in clinical epidemiology refers to a variable that impacts both the exposure (i.e., smoking) and outcome (i.e., lung cancer). A useful way to visualize this is using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). I’ll defer to Hernan and Robins (2021) for more detail about DAGs. However, the below illustrates what confounding is.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Coffee Drinkers, Smoking and Lung Cancer.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that coffee drinkers are associated with smoking. Logically, this makes sense because many smokers enjoy a cup of coffee with their cigarette. In fact, a lot of people enjoy coffee. A group of these people who are coffee lovers may also develop lung cancer. Based on this, you could say that people who drink coffee develop lung cancer. The question is, is this true? Or is it just that a lot of people like drinking coffee? Confounding bias, makes it difficult to tease out what coffee actually causes.\n\n\nRandomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)\nRandomized controlled trials are typically considered the gold standard in research. However, sometimes people forget why they are considered the gold standard. There are of course numerous reasons but I will touch on a few here. Firstly, an RCT is randomized meaning that patient’s are randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms. In theory, this is to ensure that characteristics are balanced between the treatment arms. By balancing characteristics, in theory, both observed and unobserved confounders are equal between the groups, making them exchangeable (aka similar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRandom is important to note here. There are different methods which are truly random, such as a random number generator, while there are others that are not.\nFor example, if you were picking players for a baseball team and wanted to assign people to two teams, team A & team B, how would you do it? Based on the color shirt they are wearing, hair color, eye color? None of those methods would be random.\n\n\nAnother key strength of RCTs is the nature of the intervention. For example, a well designed RCT will be very clear about what treatment is received by the participants and that all participants will receive the same treatment. Furthermore, one participant receiving a treatment won’t affect the other participant receiving treatment. It is also worth noting here that all participants in a RCT will receive some form of exposure (typically either treatment or placebo).\n\n\nObservational Data\nObservational data in research often gets a bad wrap. Since the gold standard is a RCT, people often view observational data as second-tier compared to an RCT. However, it all depends on how well the study is conducted. If the study is conducted rigorously, which is subjective but we will elaborate more below, then a study using observational data can be almost as good as an RCT."

    "section": "Conditions Required for Causal Inference",
    "text": "Conditions Required for Causal Inference\nReal-life is very complicated. For any method or analysis, such as designing a house, assumptions are required. This is is no different for causal inference. Key assumptions for causal inference include (Hernán 2012):\n\nExchangeability\nPositivity\nConsistency\nNo versions of treatment\nNo interference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCollectively, consistency, no versions of treatment and no interference have been referred to as the stable-unit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA) (Hernán 2012).\n\n\nLet’s break down these assumptions down one by one.\n\nExchangeability\nRemember confounding from earlier? Well that pesky bias is back again to haunt us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRecommend to pause here and re-read Section 2.1 if needed\n\n\nThe goal, although not always, of a lot of research is to compare two different exposures. An exposure could be a treatment, for example drug A to placebo, or to compare purple Popsicle eaters with water drinkers. An example always helps.\nLet’s pretend we want to compare purple Popsicle eaters with water drinkers, to see if there is a difference in who is hungrier. Using an existing database of hungry people, we decide we want to compare these two groups of people. In the database, there are 591 people who have reported hunger.\n\n\nTable 1: Purple Popsicle Eaters vs Water Drinkers: Demographic Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic Variable\nPurple Popsicle Eaters\n(n = 250)\nWater Drinkers\n(n = 341)\n\n\n\n\nAge, mean (SD)\n9.18 (3.39)\n42.58 (22.03)\n\n\nFemale, n (%)\n190 (76.0%)\n145 (42.5%)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows the average age and proportion of females in each of the two groups. Now, after looking at these two groups, you may think to yourself “Wait a minute…water drinks on average are 42 while purple Popsicle eaters are an average age of 9? These can’t possibly be compared!”.\nYour inclination was right. These two groups are quite different and may vary in more ways than what is shown. This lack of similarity could be reworded as a lack of exchangeability. Luckily, there are fancy stats methods to fix this, which will be the topic of other posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhile we can adjust for observed confounding, it is not possible to adjust for unobserved confounding. We simply don’t know about it, for example how many people in each group enjoy the taste of grape crush.\n\n\n\n\nPositivity\nPositivity refers to the condition that every individual has a greater than 0 probability of being assigned to each of the treatment levels (Hernan and Robins (2021), pp. 30). Logically, this makes sense because if we think about our purple Popsicle eaters and water drinks, if someone in that group had a less than 0 probability they couldn’t possibly be in that group!\n\n\nConsistency\nConsistency means that the observed outcome for every treated individual equals her outcome if she received treatment and that the observed outcome for every untreated individual equals her outcome if she had remained untreated, that is \\(Y^a = Y\\) for every individual with \\(A = a\\) (Hernan and Robins (2021), pp. 31).\nOn the surface, this seems intuitive but lets dive a little deeper. There are two components to consistency:\n\nA precise definition of the counterfactual outcome \\(Y^a\\) via a detailed specification of the superscript \\(a\\) ( Hernan and Robins (2021)\nLinkage of the counterfactual outcomes to the observed outcomes ( Hernan and Robins (2021))\n\nThe first bullet point is we essentially want to have a well defined intervention. If we think back to our purple Popsicles, we want to make sure that it is the same size, shape and brand that each participant receives. Doing this allows us to make sure that each participant is getting the same treatment.\nFor the second bullet point, remember we are using observational data for our purple Popsicle eaters. We have to make sure that for the analysis, we only treat people receiving our intervention (purple Popsicle eaters) as treated, or as Popsicle eaters, and the others as not Popsicle eaters.\n\n\nNo Versions of Treatment\nAs discussed in Section 3.3, we cannot have multiple versions of the same treatment. This would muddy our findings if we were giving different people different Popsicle. Plus, this would make it hard to determine the effect of purple Popsicles on hunger. Imagine, you gave some people a much bigger Popsicle than others. Of course they’d be less hungry!\n\n\nNo Interference\nInterference here refers to the interference of the exposure. Exposure could be treatment, infectious disease or Popsicles. For our example, and most examples in this blog, the condition of no interference will be assumed to be met. Examples where this is not met is infectious disease studies (Hernan and Robins (2021))."
