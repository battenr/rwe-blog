## Who does this apply too?

A key part of any research question is to determine who this applies too. There are several different ways to determine this but this post will focus on the causal estimand. Specifically, who does this result apply to? It's even more important when we have secondary data where patients aren't randomized to a treatment/group. Let's start with an example\

## Example

As per usual, time for an example! Say that we have a magical water gun that makes you grow taller. Before we do any analyses we need to setup our research question. In clinical epidemiology this is typically PICO(S): population, intervention, comparators, outcome and sometimes study design. The causal estimand helps us with the first letter: P by asking "who does this apply too?". Now the who refers to the target population, that is the people we are...well targeting (not necessarily those we sample and study).

For our study, we have two groups: monsters and kids. We want to figure out who the magically water gun will work on. Why? Well both monsters and kids are pretty short, their friends want to know if they will grow!

![**Kids and Monsters**](kids_monsters.png)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

n.monsters = 135
n.kids = 452

set.seed(135451)

monsters <- data.frame(
  eyes = runif(n.monsters, min = 1, max = 5),
  age = rnorm(n.monsters, mean = 100, sd = 5), # need some other metric
  group = 1
  # group = "monsters"
) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
  height = eyes*0.5 + age/1000,
  sprayed = rbinom(n.monsters, size = 1, prob = plogis(0.01*age + 0.2*eyes))
  )

kids <- data.frame(
  eyes = runif(n.kids, min = 2, max = 4), # some kids may be called "four eyes"
  age = rnorm(n.kids, mean = 5, sd = 1),
  group = 0
  # group = "kids"
) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
  height = eyes*0.5 + age/10,
  sprayed = rbinom(n.kids, size = 1, prob = plogis(0.2*age + 0.125*eyes))
  )

df <- rbind(
  monsters, 
  kids
)



```

|  Number of eyes, mean (SD)  |    2.99 (1.22)     |      2 (0)      |

## Types of Estimands

We'll focus on four causal estimands, in no particular order:

-   Average treatment effect in the population (ATE)

-   Average treatment effect in the treated (ATT)

-   Average treatment effect in the untreated (ATU)

-   Average treatment effect in the overlap (ATO)

One important thing to note here is that all of these estimands would be the same in a randomized trial because the characteristics will be the same (at least in theory) Therefore the ATT, ATU and ATE will be the same. However, not so in observational data.

## Potential Outcomes

::: callout-note
An important part here is the potential outcomes framework. The potential outcomes can be written as $Y_0$ and $Y_i$. For a binary treatment, like in our case, we can think of it as each person has two potential outcomes (one if they get sprayed by the water gun, one if not). Depending on what happens, one of the outcomes is observed.\
\
Now, the individual causal effect is $Y_1$ - $Y_0$ for each person. We can't know this for each person, so instead we take an average (if we assume certain things). In math terms, we show this as $E[Y_{1} - Y_{0}]$.

## Propensity Score

We will be using propensity scores to estimate each of these estimands. A brief overview of the propensity is that it's the conditional probability of treatment conditional on covariate. More simply put: it's the probability of being a monster based on the number of yours eyes.
:::

### ATE

The ATE is the the average treatment effect among all eligible patients in the study population (i.e., difference were they all to be treated vs were they all not to be treated) [@greifer2021choosing]. For our example, it would be the difference were all the monsters and kids sprayed with the water gun versus were the monster and kids not sprayed.

To estimate the ATE, we can use inverse probability weights.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning =FALSE}

# Note to self: example needs work. Weights are just proportions of each group (n.kids/n.total)

library(WeightIt)

# work through an example in a side script (aka not here)

```

Ta da! Now we know \[INSERT\]

### ATT

The ATT is the effect of the treatment for a population of patients *like* those who actually received the treatment in the study [@greifer2021choosing] (note: this is the population, not the actual sample we have here). For our study the question would be "How would monsters outcomes differ on average, had they not been sprayed with the height water gun?" \
\
We can think of the ATT as the effect of withholding treatment from those who would otherwise receive it. In term of weights, all of the patients in the treated group get a value of 1 while those in the control get a value of PS/1-PS.

### ATU

The ATU is similar to the ATT except opposite (okay admittedly that sentence isn't fully coherent). The ATU is asking how would untreated patients differ if they had actually received treatment? That is, what would be the effect of expanding the treatment to those who haven't had it yet?

In terms of weights it's the opposite of the ATT: 1 for those in the control group and (1-PS)/PS for the treated group.

### ATO

ATO is the average effect of the treatment in the overlap. Those patients who it's unclear if the benefits would outweigh the costs [@greifer2021choosing]. These patients are very similar to each other but less similar for patients who the treatment decisions are more "clear cut" so to say [@greifer2021choosing].

## Choose Your Adjustment Technique Wisely!

Picking the estimand of interest isn't just important for the target population but also for the adjustment technique selected. Certain ones can only target certain estimands. This becomes even more important when you are comparing methods. For example, IPW and PSM do not target the same estimand [@greifer2021choosing].
