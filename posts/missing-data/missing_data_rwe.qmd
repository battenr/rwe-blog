# Missing Data

Missing data are inevitable when dealing with real-world data. Due to this, it's important to have a plan for dealing with missing data. There are tons of different methods that can be used for missing data but this post will focus on four methods: multiple imputation, k nearest neighbour imputation, regression imputation and last observation carried forward. In order to make a valid causal inference we need to have an appropriate plan.

Before we get started, we need to go over the

# Missing Data Mechanisms

## Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

## Missing at Random (MAR)

## Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

# Picking a Method

There are several methods which we'll go over below. The layout is as follows: overview of what the method is, assumptions (what's required of the method), use cases and then an example in R.
