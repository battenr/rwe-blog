## IV Methods

To perform their magic, IV methods need an instrumental variable or an instrument. It needs to meet three instrumental conditions:

1.  *Z* is associated with *A*

2.  *Z* does not affect *Y* except through its potential affect on *A*

3.  *Z* and *Y* do not share causes

For example, in a double-blind trial, the randomization is an instrument because: i) trial participants are more likely to receive treatment if they were assigned to treatment, ii) expected by double-blind design, iii) random assignment of Z.
