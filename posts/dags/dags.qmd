## "Don't Analyze Graphs?"

Yes..well no...well kinda. DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph, simply put it is a graph that is directed and acyclic. Okay, that's not much of an explanation. To explain it a bit further before adding any images (there will be lots of pictures this post, yippee!), a DAG is a great way to depict how your variables are related. To quote Miguel Hernan, since I couldn't have put it better myself, "Draw your assumptions before your conclusions".

A DAG can help contain information

## "Think of Water Flowing in a Pipe"....What?

One of the peskiest biases

Sure, how about "Don't Analyze Graphs"? It's a bit tongue-in-cheek, implying that you should just trust the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) without over-analyzing it. Of course, in reality, careful analysis is often necessary to ensure the accuracy and validity of DAGs used in various applications such as machine learning.

How about "Dramatic Action Graph"? It's not necessarily hilarious, but it adds a bit of flair to the otherwise technical-sounding term DAG!
