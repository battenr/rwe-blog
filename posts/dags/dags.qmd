## "Don't Analyze Graphs?"

Yes..well no...well kinda. DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph, simply put it is a graph that is directed and acyclic. Okay, that's not much of an explanation. To explain it a bit further before adding any images (there will be lots of pictures this post, yippee!), a DAG is a great way to depict how your variables are related. To quote Miguel Hernan, since I couldn't have put it better myself, "Draw your assumptions before your conclusions".

In this post, we're going to go over the basics of DAGs, however this isn't meant to encompass all aspects of causal diagrams. More of a "wetting your beak" if you will. There will be future posts that will build upon this. Without further ado, let's get into it.

## Assumptions of DAGs

The causal Markov assumption, implies that in a causal DAG, the common causes of any pair of variables must also be in the graph. The willingness to consider a causal diagram for an observational study is the graphical version of the conditional exchangeability assumption:\
\
given $L, Y^a \perp A|L$

## Rules of DAGs

There are some basic rules of DAGs:

1.  

## Why do we need a DAG?

Before we get started into what it actually is and the rules, it's always a good idea to review the why.

## Simple DAG

## "Think of Water Flowing in a Pipe"....What?

One of the peskiest biases

## Title ideas (from ChatGPT)

Sure, how about "Don't Analyze Graphs"? It's a bit tongue-in-cheek, implying that you should just trust the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) without over-analyzing it. Of course, in reality, careful analysis is often necessary to ensure the accuracy and validity of DAGs used in various applications such as machine learning.

How about "Dramatic Action Graph"? It's not necessarily hilarious, but it adds a bit of flair to the otherwise technical-sounding term DAG!
