## Marginally Important

This post is going to be about marginally compared to conditional effects in clinical epidemiology. First, we need to understand what in the world these terms even mean. To do that, can you guess what we are going to start with? Yup! Probability again.

## Conditional vs Unconditional Probability

First things first. Let's review some basic probability terms. Unconditional probability, denoted as $P(A)$, is the probability that something will happen. Unconditional probability sounds like a mouthful, so we will use marginal instead. For example, let's assume in a made-up world that the probability of you getting a visit from the toothfairy is 0.30 on any given night. In mathematical terms:

$$
P(\text{toothfairy visit}) = 0.30
$$

Now, the toothfairy randomly visiting you seems a bit bizarre doesn't it? She'd just drop by any night for no reason at all? Maybe if you wore your favorite pink pyjamas to bed she'd visit. This can be worded as "the probability that the toothfairy will visit, given that you are wearing pink pyjamas to bed". Using mathematical notation again:

$$
P(\text{toothfairy visit} | \text{wearing pink pyjamas}) 
$$

Now, how do we calculate that? Well, the below formula [@wassertheil2004biostatistics]

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(\text{A and B})}{P(B)}
$$

$$
P(\text{toothfairy visit | wearing pink pyjamas}) = \frac{P(\text{toothfairy visit and wearing pink pyjamas})}{P(\text{wearing pink pyjamas})} 
$$

This same logic goes for when we are conducting studies.

## Conditional Mean

### Parametric Estimators of the Conditional Mean

The point of a model is to estimate value $E$ of some parameter. The parameter could be the mean or some other measure. Let's assume that we use the toothfairy visit example again. We want to know the average number of toothfairy visits among people wearing pink pyjamas. In math terms, that would be

$$
E[\text{Toothfairy visits} | \text {Pink pyjamas}] 
$$

To figure this out, we need a model.

$$
E[\text{Toothfairy visits} | \text {Pink pyjamas}] = \theta_0 + \theta_1*\text{pink pyjamas}
$$

The equation above is called a **parametric conditional mean model**, because it describes the conditional mean function in terms of a finite number of parameters (note: $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are referred to as parameters).

Once we've fitted some data to the model, we can determine the predicted value for each individual. The notation typically used is

$$
\hat{E}[\text{Toothfairy visits} | \text{pink pyjamas = yes}] = \hat{\theta_0} + \hat{\theta_1}*Yes
$$

### Nonparametric Estimators of the Conditional Mean

## Effect Modification

The marginal effect measure, would be that that is unconditional (i.e., does not depend on covariates). There are certain methods that can provide a marginal effect measure, while there are others that cannot. Standardization and IP weighting can be used to compute either ***marginal*** or ***conditional*** effects. Stratification/restriction and matching can only be used to compute ***conditional*** effects in certain subsets of the population [@hernanwhatif, pp.51]. Let's break down each of these methods one by one.
