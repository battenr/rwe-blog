## Marginally Important

This post is going to be about marginally compared to conditional effects in clinical epidemiology. First, we need to understand what is meant by these terms. To do that, can you guess what we are going to start with? Yup! Probability again

## Conditional vs Unconditional Probability

First things first. Let's review some basic probability terms.

## 

## 2x2 Table

First, lets start with a 2x2 table. It could be of anything really, but let's imagine we have two groups of people

```{r, include = FALSE}

set.seed(2022)

n.bg <- runif(1, min = 100, max = 500)
n.tc <- runif(1, min = 100, max = 500)

n.bg.sj <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 426) # Bubble Gum & Sore Jaw
n.bg.nsj <- 426 - 78

n.tc.sj <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 359)
n.tc.nsj = 359-228

```
