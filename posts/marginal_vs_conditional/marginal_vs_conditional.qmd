set.seed(2022)

n.bg <- runif()

|              | Bubble Gum Chewers | Tobacco Chewers |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Sore Jaw     |                    |                 |
| Not Sore Jaw |                    |                 |
|              |                    |                 |
