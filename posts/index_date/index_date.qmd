## What the hell is an index date?

An index date, also known as time zero, is the time-point where you start measuring from. For example, in a clinical trial setting this is typically the date that the patient receives treatment or can be the date the patient is treated (if you are doing an intention to treat analysis).

For real-world evidence it isn't so straightforward. Picking the wrong date can result in some unnecessary, self-imposed biases. So how do we pick a date? Just pick a random date? Not exactly.

## Can I pick any date?

Technically yes, but no. Only if you want to have a lot of biases in your study.
