## What the hell is an index date?

An index date, also known as time zero, is the timepoint where you start measuring from. For example, in a clinical trial setting this could be the date that the patient receives treatment or if you are doing an intention to treat analysis it

## Can I pick any date?

Technically yes, but no. Only if you want to have a lot of biases in your study.
