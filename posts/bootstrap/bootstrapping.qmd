## Uncertainty

A key part of any analysis is to determine the uncertainty associated with an estimate. Sometimes this can be especially tricky with certain methods such as inverse probability weighting and standardization. One way to estimate the uncertainty nonparametrically, that is without assuming anything about the distribution, is bootstrapping.

## Vary Away!

"So what you're telling me is I can just use bootstrapping all the time for every test?" Well, no. It is a useful tool but like all tools, whether statistical or not, there is a time and a place to use them. Would you use a hammer as a fly swatter? I guess you could, but why not just use a fly swatter.

## **Pros and Cons of Bootstrapping**

Bootstrapping is a widely-used technique in statistics for its simplicity and versatility. However, like any method, it has its strengths and weaknesses. Below, we explore some of the pros and cons of using bootstrapping.

### **Pros**

1.  **Simplicity**: Bootstrapping is conceptually simple and easy to implement. It doesn't require strong assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.

2.  **Versatility**: It can be applied to a wide range of statistics and models, making it useful for various types of data analysis, including causal inference.

3.  **Small Sample Sizes**: Bootstrapping can be particularly useful when you have a small sample size, as it allows you to make more robust inferences.

4.  **Non-Parametric**: It's a non-parametric method, meaning it doesn't assume a specific form for the distribution of the data. This makes it flexible and widely applicable.

5.  **Computational Efficiency**: With modern computing power, bootstrapping can be done quickly, even for large datasets.

6.  **Confidence Intervals**: Easily compute confidence intervals for complex estimators where analytical solutions may not be available.

7.  **Model Validation**: Can be used for internal validation of models, assessing the stability of results.

### **Cons**

1.  **Not Always Accurate**: The accuracy of bootstrapping depends on the data and the statistic being estimated. It may not perform well for highly skewed data or for statistics that are sensitive to outliers.

2.  **Computational Cost**: While generally efficient, bootstrapping can be computationally expensive if the dataset is large or if a large number of bootstrap samples are needed.

3.  **Independence Assumption**: Assumes that the observations are independent. If this assumption is violated (e.g., in time-series data), then bootstrapping may give misleading results.

4.  **Limited External Validity**: Bootstrapping only resamples from the existing data, so it can't capture variations or features not present in the original sample. This limits its external validity.

5.  **Pseudo-Replication**: Since bootstrapping involves resampling with replacement, it creates "pseudo-replicates" rather than true replicates, which may not fully capture the uncertainty in some cases.

6.  **Boundary Estimates**: For some statistics, bootstrapping can produce biased confidence intervals that do not contain the true parameter value, especially for small sample sizes.

7.  **Not a Substitute for Real Data**: While bootstrapping can enhance an analysis, it's not a substitute for collecting more or better-quality data.

### **Conclusion**

Bootstrapping is a powerful tool but should be used thoughtfully. Understanding its limitations is crucial for interpreting the results correctly, especially in complex analyses like causal inference. Given its pros and cons, it often serves as a useful complement to other statistical methods.
