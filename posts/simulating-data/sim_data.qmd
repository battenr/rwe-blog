Learning to simulate data was one of the best things that I've stumbled into. It can help improve your knowledge of statistics and inform decision making. One of the things I found difficult when starting was for a resource that gave some examples of what I really wanted to know. Hopefully this post will provide a decent start to someone.

## Why Simulate?

At first, I had heard about simulation studies but wasn't exactly sure the purpose of them.

## Steps to Simulate

@morris2019 use the acronym ADEMP: Aims, Data-generating mechanisms, Methods, Estimands and Performance measures. This is a great acronym which we'l'' break down a little bit .

## Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is

## Resources for Simulating

There are a ton of good resources when it comes to design aspects of simulation study. Two that help me think about simulation studies are @morris2019 and @burton2006.
