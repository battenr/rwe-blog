## Simulating Data, Why?

Simulating data wasn't something that I was taught in school. I've learned it since graduating/during my PhD, in my pursuit of improving my stats knowledge (the more I learn the more I feel I don't know, weird feeling). It's been unbelievably useful.

Some use case:

I wanted to write this blog to help anyone else who isn't familiar with simulating data. Before, I just want to give a sliver of uses where I've found simulating data helpful:

-   Showing bias (confounder, collider, etc)

-   Understanding how methods work

-   Comparing difference methods (1:1 matching vs IPTW, etc)

-   Understand data generating mechanisms

-

## Stats for non-stats

I'm a tradesman biostatistician \[NOTE: RYAN CHECK THIS TERM FROM HIS TWEET\] (credit to PhDemetri for this term). Basically, I've done a few statistics courses but don't have a degree in it (I do in clinical epidemiology which overlaps substantially with biostatistics).

If you do, hopefully this is a good refresher. If you don't, don't worry! I don't either so hopefully this helps out a little as an intro.

## Basics

Before we dive into some R code, which I do love, it's useful to first understand at a high level how this works. Before you scramble to close this, wait! I promise it isn't going to be technical or boring. Alright, let's get started

Imagine we have a bag of coffee beans. These range in shape and size. Suppose we know that the average weight is 135 milligrams and 16 (10 to 22/64 of an inch). Now, does this mean that every bean will be that? Let's pull one out and see

## Simulating Data

We'll start with continuous data. To simulate this we need two pieces of information, also known as parameters: mean and standard deviation.

## TTE Outcome

This post will focus on continuous and binary outcomes. A future blog post will go over how to simulate time-to-event, sometimes called survival, data.

NOTE TO SELF: explain that regression is finding the mean (keith mcnulty's post)

Now, if we pick one

# Old Text

Learning to simulate data was one of the best things that I've stumbled into. It can help improve your knowledge of statistics and inform decision making. One of the things I found difficult when starting was for a resource that gave some examples of what I really wanted to know. Hopefully this post will provide a decent start to someone.

## Why Simulate?

At first, I had heard about simulation studies but wasn't exactly sure the purpose of them.

## Steps to Simulate

\@morris2019 use the acronym ADEMP: Aims, Data-generating mechanisms, Methods, Estimands and Performance measures. This is a great acronym which we'l'' break down a little bit .

## Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is

## Resources for Simulating

There are a ton of good resources when it comes to design aspects of simulation study. Two that help me think about simulation studies are \@morris2019 and \@burton2006.
