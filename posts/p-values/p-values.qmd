P-values are a term commonly heard in scientific literature, however often they are misconstrued, misunderstood or misinterpreted. The p in p-value stands for probability, as a lot of statistics begins with. What exactly does it tell us? Let's find out

## Formal Definitions 

### Hypotheses

Hypotheses are the best place to start for any science experiment or project.

### Type I and II Errors

A type I error, sometimes referred to as $\alpha$ error, is the error of saying something happened when it did not. For example, the error of me assuming you bought a balloon **when you did not**. A type II error, sometimes referred to as $\beta$ error, is the error of saying something did not happen **when you did**. Using our balloon example, me assuming you didn't buy a balloon when you did.

### Power

The power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis [@gelman2014beyond]. \$1-$\beta$ or the pwoer of

### P-Value

The probability of such an extreme value of the test statistic occuring if the null hypothesis were true is often called the **P Value @bland2015introduction.** Similarly, the significance level

### Significance Level

## Normal Distribution

To begin, we need to start with some data. Who doesn't love data right?

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

df <- rnorm(1000, mean = 30, sd = 10) %>% as.data.frame()

df$x <- df$.

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = x) ) + 
  geom_density() +
  theme_minimal() 
  

```

## Issues with the P-Value

P-values are typically over emphasized. They are a piece of the puzzle, however they are not the whole puzzle.

### Type M & Type S Error

Often type I and type II errors are highlighted however type M and type S errors are important to note as well. A type S error is the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction [@gelman2014beyond]. A type M error is the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated [@gelman2014beyond].

Definitions are always great but an example helps to better understand. Without any further
